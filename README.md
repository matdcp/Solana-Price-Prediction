Solana Price Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains a deep learning project aimed at predicting the price of Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency over different time horizons (1, 3, and 7 days) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the sequential data modeling capabilities of LSTM to forecast Solana prices based on historical data. The results can assist in understanding market trends and help in decision-making processes.

Features

Time Series Forecasting: Predict Solana prices for 1, 3, and 7 days into the future.
Deep Learning Model: Built with LSTM, which is highly effective for sequential data analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization, splitting into train/test sets, and sequence generation.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and other key metrics are used to assess model performance.
